This is a simple strategy game. It's a project that I use to learn Java.

You play the role as the leader of a scientific grant agency. Your aim is to create a technology empire by funding the right scientists.

In each round, you have four grant applications to choose from. Since the projects themselves are very technical, the only way to identify successful projects is to examine the publicly available information on the authors:
 
* the h-index of the researcher
* the age of the researcher

The four choices are currently displayed as follows.

Good researchers have a high h-index for their age.

Later on, you can get more detailed and useful information, such as the output of their previously funded projects. Finding good researchers and projects is really not that easy.

The researcher names and h-indices refer to REAL scientists, who have publicly released their information on google scholar. You can replace this as you like. 

Your initial aim is to gather advances in the fields of Biology, Physics or Chemistry. When you have gathered enough basic research points in one of these fields, you can start funding applied research projects, which hopefully spin off into a new technology company.

Currently only the initial part of the game is initiated.
